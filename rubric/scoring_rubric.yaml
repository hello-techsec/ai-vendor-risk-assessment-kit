rules:
  - question_id: Q6
    when: "Yes - no opt-out"
    add_points: 5
    rationale: "Customer data used for training without opt-out increases privacy/compliance risk."

  - question_id: Q6
    when: "Yes - opt-out available"
    add_points: 2
    rationale: "Training use still raises risk, but mitigations exist."

  - question_id: Q6
    when: "No"
    add_points: 0
    rationale: "No training use reduces privacy and IP risk."

  - question_id: Q13
    when: "No"
    add_points: 3
    rationale: "No stated SLA weakens resiliency posture."
